<h1>make_shared (sub)object destruction semantics are not specified</h1>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The remarks for the <code>make_shared</code> and
<code>allocate_shared</code> functions do not specify how the objects managed
by the returned <code>shared_ptr</code> are destroyed. It is implied that when
objects are constructed via a placement new expression, they are destroyed by
calling the destructor, and that when objects are constructed via an allocator,
they are destroyed using that allocator. This should be explicitly
specified.</p>
<h2>Proposed resolution</h2>
<p>This resolution is relative to N4687.</p>
<p>1. Edit 23.11.2.2.6 [util.smartptr.shared.create]/7 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(7.9) &mdash; When the lifetime of the object managed by the return
value ends, or when the initialization of an array element throws an exception,
the initialized elements should be destroyed in the reverse order of their
construction.</p>
<p><ins>(7.10) &mdash; When a (sub)object of a non-array type <code>U</code>
that was initialized by <code>make_shared</code> is to be destroyed, it shall
be destroyed via the expression <code>pv-&gt;~U()</code> where <code>pv</code>
points to an object of type <code>U</code>.</ins></p>
<p><ins>(7.11) &mdash; When a (sub)object of a non-array type <code>U</code>
that was initialized by <code>allocate_shared</code> is to be destroyed, it
shall be destroyed via the expression
<code>allocator_traits&lt;A2&gt;::destroy(a2, pv)</code> where <code>pv</code>
points to an object of type <em>cv</em>-unqualified <code>U</code> and
<code>a2</code> of type <code>A2</code> is a rebound copy of the allocator
<code>a</code> passed to <code>allocate_shared</code> such that its
<code>value_type</code> is <code>remove_cv_t&lt;U&gt;</code>.</ins></p>
